FITS Standards
--------------

**FITS** (**F**\ lexible **I**\ mage **T**\ ransport **S**\ ystem) has been
widely used to storage images in astronomy.
The latest FITS standard (version 3.0) is defined by Pence et al. 2010
[#Pence2010]_.
Briefly speaking, the FITS file is composed of a primary header and data unit
(HDU) and optional extensions.
For the raw data files generated by FOCES, the single image FITS with only one
primary HDU is used.
The primary HDU contains a header and a data array.
The header is composed of a number of 80-character records.
Each record contains a keyword name, a value and an optional comment.
The keyword name shall has 8 left-justified, and space-filled characters.
The following keywords for a 2-D image array are fixed in the beginning of the
primary HDU according to the FITS standard document::

    SIMPLE  =                    T / file does conform to FITS standard
    BITPIX  =                   16 / number of bits per data pixel
    NAXIS   =                    2 / number of data axes
    NAXIS1  =                 2088 / length of data axis 1
    NAXIS2  =                 2048 / length of data axis 2

Below shows an example of keywords in the primary HDU of FITS files.
The first two and last two rows with digits are used to rule the length of
header rows::

  0         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8

Below are explanations for keywords

#. Keywords describing the data array

   The arrays generated by the FOCES controlling computer are 3-D by default,
   with the length of the 3rd direction equal to 1.
   These should be converted to 2-D arrays so that EDRS2 does not need a special
   treatment for FOCES data. **BSCALE** and **BZERO** are used to linearly scale
   the array values to the physical values by

   *physical_value* = **BZERO** + **BSCALE** × *array_value*

   Here we use **BZERO** = 32768 and **BSCALE** = 1 to represent unsigned,
   16-bit integers in the CCD in a signed integer FITS array.
   **BUNIT** is the unit of physical values (in our case, ADU of the CCD).
   **BLANK** = -32768 means we use the unsigned 0 to represent the undefined
   physical value in the pixel.
   **DISPAXIS** describes the axis along which the main dispersion direction is.

#. Keywords describing the observed objects

   There are two kinds of “data types”, i.e. the calibration (including bias,
   flat, dark, ThAr, … ) and the science (a real observed object).
   This information is stored in the **DATATYPE** as characters ('calibration'
   or 'science'). **RADESYS** and **EQUINOX** specify the coordinate system and
   the epoch of the object. Their allowed values are

   ========================================== =========== =========================
   Definition                                 **RADESYS** **EQUINOX**
   ========================================== =========== =========================
   International Celestial Reference System   ICRS
   Mean place, new (IAU 1984) system          FK5         a floating Julian year
   Mean place, old (Bessel-Newcomb) system    FK4         a floating Besselian year
   Mean place: but without eccentricity terms FK4-NO-E    a floating Besselian year
   Geocentric apparent place, IAU 1984 system GAPPT
   ========================================== =========== =========================

   The allowed **OBJECT** values are any characters specifying the science
   object or the calibration object, such as '51 Peg', 'HD 122563', 'Flat', or
   'Laser Comb'.
   
#. Keywords describing the observation information

   **DATE-OBS** is the start date of an observation run.
   The observation run is defined as a whole process contains a series of
   calibration frames (including bias, flat, ThAr…) and the optional science
   frames (depending on whether any celestial object is observed).
   The start date shall always be kept as the date before the mid-night.
   **MJD-OBS** is the Modified Julian Date of **DATE-OBS**\ .
   **FRAMEID** is an unique integer identifying the FITS file.
   This number shall start from 1 and increase with time in every observation
   run, but may not be continuous. **DATE-OBS** and **FRAMEID** can be used to
   identify a raw FITS file generated by FOCES.

#. Keywords describing the time of exposure

   **TIMESYS** specifies the time scale used in the header.
   The allowed values include `UT`, `UTC`, `TAI`, `AT`, `ET`, `UT`, `TDT`,
   `TDB`, `TCG`, and `TDB`. The `GPS` has been deprecated.
   There are four groups of keywords describing the time, i.e., `UTC-XXX`
   (Coordinated Universal Time), `LT-XXX` (local time), `LST-XXX` (local
   sidereal time), and `MJD-XXX` (Modified Julian Date), where `XXX` are either
   `STA` (start of the exposure), `MID` (middle time of the exposure), `PHO`
   (photon-weighted middle time of the exposure), or `END` (end of the
   exposure).
   Similarly, the pointing angle of the telescope, and airmass of the above four
   time points are recorded to estimate the atmospheric extinction.
   The effective airmass is calculated as

   **AIRMASS** = (**AIRM_STA** + 3 × **AIRM_MID** + **AIRM_END**)/5.

   The keywords related to the airmass are empty if **DATATYPE** =
   `calibration`.
   Additionally, the **MOON-PHA**, **MOON-DIS**, **TWI-END**, and **TWI-STA**
   are included to estimate the sky background level of the spectral image.

#. Keywords related to the multi-channel

   A channel is defined as the light from different objects fed by a specific
   fiber before the slit.
   **NCHANNEL** describes the number of used channel.
   In normal mode, **NCHANNEL** = 1, and = 2 if simultaneous reference technique
   is used.
   **CHANNELn** describe the objects fed in each channel, where n = 1, 2, ...
   **NCHANNEL**.
   The allowed values are `science`, `flat`, `ThAr`, `comb`.
   Similarly, **FILTERn** specify the used filter (if any) in each channel.

#. Keywords related to the exposure meter

   The exposure meter (or photon counter) is often used in precise Doppler
   measurements to determine the effective time points of the radial velocity
   data.
   The logical keyword **EXPMETER** is introduced to specify whether the
   exposure meter is switched on during the exposure.
   **PHO-OFF** is used to measure the offset between the photon-weighted middle
   time and the middle time.
   The unit of the value in **PHO-OFF** is second.
   **PHO-OFF** = 1.0 means the the photon-weighted middle time = middle time +
   1.0 sec.
   If the exposure meter is off, **PHO-OFF** = 0., and all keywords ended with
   **-PHO** are kept the same as those with **-MID**.
