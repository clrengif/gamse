`GAMSE` is a data reduction package for high-resolution Ã©chelle spectrographs.
It contains necessary subroutines in spectral reduction process, including
overscan correction, bias subtraction, order detection, flat-fielding
correction, background correction, and optimal extraction.
GAMSE supports a variety of instruments, e.g. FOCES on the 2m Fraunhofer
Telescope in Wendelstein Observatory, and HRS on the 2.16m telescope in Xinglong
Observatory.

Dependencies
------------
`GAMSE` is based on Python 3.4 or later, and does not work in Python 2.x.
To use `GAMSE` the following packages are required:

* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ 1.16.1 or later: A Python library for
  multi-dimensional arrays and mathematics.
* `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ 0.17.0 or later: A Python library for
  scientific computing.
* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ 2.2.0 or later: To display and
  generate output figures.
* `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_ 3.1.1 or later: To read and write FITS
  files and ASCII tables.

Installation
------------

To install `GAMSE` package with `pip`, simply usethe following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo pip install gamse

Or alternatively, clone the whole repository with GIT:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/wangleon/gamse.git

Then run the setup script in the cloned directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo python3 setup.py install

General Description
-------------------
The reduction procedure and the input parameters are controlled by an
user-defined ASCII configuration file.
It consists of a series of key/values delimited by the equal signs.
Comments prefixed by hash (#) or semicolons (;) symbols are supported,




.. _getting_started:

Getting Started with GAMSE
--------------------------
Extracting one-dimensional spectra from raw images using `GAMSE` is simple.
Basically there are only 4 steps

#. Prepare a working directory and link the raw data.
#. Create an ASCII config file by running

   .. code-block:: bash

      gamse config

#. Generate an observing log file by running
  
   .. code-block:: bash

      gamse list

#. Calibrate the data and extract the spectra by running
  
   .. code-block:: bash

      gamse reduce

However, the config and observing log files for a specific instrument might be
slightly different with others, as every spectrograph is different with others.
We recommend the users to reduce their data following the guide of individual
spectrograph.
